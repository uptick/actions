            Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.

            Refer to CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md for patterns / context / best practices.

            If AGENTS_CODEREVIEW.md exists, follow the instructions in that file. If AGENTS_CODEREVIEW.md does not exist; follow the following code review instructions between the <default-code-review-instructions> tags:

            <default-code-review-instructions>
            Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Code Quality**
               - Clean code principles and best practices
               - Proper error handling and edge cases
               - Code readability and maintainability

            2. **Security**
               - Check for potential security vulnerabilities
               - Validate input sanitization
               - Review authentication/authorization logic

            3. **Performance**
               - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
               - Review database queries for efficiency
               - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

            4. **Testing**
               - Verify adequate test coverage
               - Review test quality and edge cases
               - Check for missing test scenarios
            </default-code-review-instructions>

            Additional Instructions:

            Scope:
            - REVIEW ONLY THE LATEST CHANGES (latest commit).
            - Avoid duplicates and items already fixed or discussed (read existing PR comments/reviews).

            How to inspect:
            - HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)
            - gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json files,comments,reviews
            - git diff --unified=0 "${HEAD_SHA}^" "${HEAD_SHA}" (focus on RIGHT-side additions/edits)

            Optional prior context (only if helpful):
            - gh pr list --state merged --limit 10
            - gh pr view <number> --json title,body,files
            - gh pr diff  <number>

            Posting rules (no file writes):

            Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
            Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.

            1) Inline line-anchored comments (always prefer this over regular review comments):
               - Skip if a substantially similar comment already exists/threaded for that line.
               - Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
               - Do not leave inline comments for stylistic nitpicks (whitespace, formatting, etc)

            2) If no major or critical issues are found:
               - Post exactly one success comment:
                 gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body 'LGTM ✅'

            3) If you cannot reliably compute position for a truly critical issue (last resort only):
               - Post a regular review comment referencing the file and line in the body so it’s still actionable:
                 gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment --body "### Issue: <short title>\nFile: <path> @ <approx line>\nWhy: <impact>\nFix: <concrete steps>\n\n```ts\n// minimal example or patch\n```"

            Rules:
            - Use only Bash (gh, git) plus Read/Grep/Glob; do NOT write files.
            - Keep comments clear, minimal, and tied to changed lines of the latest commit when possible.
            - Only post when you can propose a concrete, actionable fix.
