    #         REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
    #         PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

    #         Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.

    #         Refer to CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md for patterns / context / best practices.

    #         If AGENTS_CODEREVIEW.md exists, follow the instructions in that file. If AGENTS_CODEREVIEW.md does not exist; follow the following code review instructions between the <default-code-review-instructions> tags:

    #         <default-code-review-instructions>
    #         Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

    #         1. **Code Quality**
    #            - Clean code principles and best practices
    #            - Proper error handling and edge cases
    #            - Code readability and maintainability

    #         2. **Security**
    #            - Check for potential security vulnerabilities
    #            - Check for embedded secrets
    #            - Check for PII leaks and other hardcoded values that could potentially cause data leaks
    #            - Validate input sanitization
    #            - Review authentication/authorization logic

    #         3. **Performance**
    #            - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
    #            - Review database queries for efficiency
    #            - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

    #         4. **Testing**
    #            - Verify adequate test coverage
    #            - Review test quality and edge cases
    #            - Check for missing test scenarios
    #         </default-code-review-instructions>

    #         ## Instructions for reviewing the latest changes

    #         Scope:
    #         - REVIEW ONLY THE LATEST CHANGES in the PR branch.
    #         - Avoid duplicates and items already fixed or discussed (read existing PR comments/reviews).

    #         How to inspect:
    #         1. Get the HEAD SHA:
    #           `HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)`
    #         2. Read up existing files, comments, and reviews:
    #           `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json files,comments,reviews,title`
    #         3. getting the diff between changes (focus on RIGHT-side additions/edits):
    #           `git diff --unified=0 "${HEAD_SHA}^" "${HEAD_SHA}"`

    #         ## Posting rules
    #         - DO NOT write to files
    #         - Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
    #         - Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
    #         - Delete the old top-level feedback comment if it already exists and create a new one with the latest feedback.
    #         - Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.
    #         - Keep comments clear, minimal, and tied to changed lines of the latest commit when possible.
    #         - Only post when you can propose a concrete, actionable fix.

    #         1) Inline line-anchored comments (always prefer this over regular review comments):
    #            - Skip if a substantially similar comment already exists/threaded for that line.
    #            - Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
    #            - Do not leave inline comments for stylistic nitpicks (whitespace, formatting, etc)

    #         2) If no major or critical issues are found:
    #            - Post exactly one success comment:
    #              gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body 'LGTM ✅'

    #         3) If you cannot reliably compute position for a truly critical issue (last resort only):
    #            - Post a regular review comment referencing the file and line in the body so it’s still actionable:
    #              gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment --body "### Issue: <short title>\nFile: <path> @ <approx line>\nWhy: <impact>\nFix: <concrete steps>\n\n```ts\n// minimal example or patch\n```"

    #         4) Update the top-level feedback comment if it already exists via: `mcp__github_comment__update_claude_comment`
